Contains both rate and spiking network model implementations from the paper Jercog et al 2017. Both models generate the time courses for E & I population rates and adaptation presented. In addition, the Spiking network generates individual spiking activity in rasters. A complete description of the model is provided in the methods of the paper.

Rate model (Matlab 2009 - Linux).
  Include following files in a separated folder:
  singleSimEIModel.m: main function (also plots the output traces).
  eiModelParams.m: model parameters.
  eiModel.mexa64: Compiled MEX-function from source eiModel.cpp (Unix).
  eiModel.cpp: c++ mex-function source.
  rate_readme.txt: description.

Spiking Model (g++ 6.4.3 - Linux):
  Include following files in a separated folder:
  main.cpp: main function, generate output bin files.
  functions.h:   auxiliar functions.
  functions.cpp: auxiliar functions.
  spiking_readme.txt: description.

Further instructions for usage of each model in their corresponding readme-files.
